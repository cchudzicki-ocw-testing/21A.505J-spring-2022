### Students will create a sound object — a musical or sound art composition, a soundscape, a podcast, a mash-up, a supercut—by semester’s end. In-class sessions will provide guidance on digital audio workstations, mixing, studio use. An aspirational goal of the class will be to create an album we can post on [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

### Session 3 due

Using [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/), a Digital Audio Workstation, create a rhythmic segment between two and 16 measures long. Be prepared to share about 30 seconds of your audio in class. We’ll be curious to hear about your process, and about your observations around learning, improvising, and evaluating your different attempts.

### Session 5 due

Write a 1-page, double-spaced description of the sound object you intend to make. We will share drafts halfway through the term, and Ian will give feedback. The goal is to prepare the sound objects so that by the end of the semester they can be uploaded as an album on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), though this is optional.

Requirements: The goal is to experiment with recording, mixing, adding effects, editing, transforming sounds. Ideally, we will get to the point where we can use surround sound mixing in the Spatial Sound Lab. Some possible sound objects:

- a musical composition of any kind
- a soundscape that evokes a social setting or particular place
- a podcast composed of multiple voices and perspectives
- a dramatic narrative of some sort (audio play?) of your own making
- a supercut, mashup or other sample-based composition

### Session 6 due

Students will write a short (1500 words) paper on any aspect of the readings up through that date that have inspired them and that may inflect the making of their class sound object.
